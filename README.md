# House Price Prediction 🏠💸
House Price Prediction  Predicting house prices using machine learning based on factors such as size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, and location (zip code). This project aims to develop accurate models to forecast house prices, leveraging data analysis and machine learning algorithms for insightful predictions.

## Overview ℹ️

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, and location (zip code). The techniques used include linear regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, and model serialization using pickle.

## Features 📊

- **beds**: Number of bedrooms
- **baths**: Number of bathrooms
- **size**: Size of the house in square feet
- **lot_size**: Size of the lot in square feet
- **zip_code**: Location identifier

## Techniques Used 🛠️

- **Linear Regression**: Basic model for predicting house prices.
- **Lasso Regression**: Incorporates L1 regularization to improve model robustness.
- **Ridge Regression**: Utilizes L2 regularization to handle multicollinearity in the data.
- **Pickle**: Serialization technique to save trained models for later use.

## Data 📈

The dataset used for this project includes information on house features and corresponding prices.

## Methodology 🚀

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding relationships and patterns in the data.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge).
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance and fine-tuning for accuracy.
5. **Serialization**: Saving models using pickle for deployment and future predictions.
